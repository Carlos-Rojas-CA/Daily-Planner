# Unit 05 Third-Party APIs Homework: Day Planner

## Application:

This planner should be about to take in single inputs for events of the day. It will take the current time and date and display it at the top with the date. And, the current time will change the colors of the input boxes based on if it is the current hour. Typing into the input box and clicking save will save the input into the local storage. When the website loads up, it should search your local stoarge for any previous save events for that current date. If it is not the same day, it will rewrite all saved events from previous days.

Since the format for everyday is the same, I just added it to the HTML instead of creating each element using jQuerey or JS.
